This is my second project in PHP. in order to gain experience with API development and some concepts like interactivity etc, i made a realy simple php webchat that is not realtime, with two main roles : 

The user, that can send and delete his own message, and change his password.
The admin, that can delete all the messages, change his password, and delete the account of anyone.
