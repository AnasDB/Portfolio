Created using the **Laravel/Livewire** stack + vanilla JS and CSS, this web app allows multiplayer, real-time tic-tac-toe gameplay. The application is secured with email address validation and the option to use TFA (TOTP). Finally, the project includes internationalization, with French and English currently supported.
