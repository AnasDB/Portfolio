In order to gain experience with Restful-API development and some concepts like interactivity, responsive UI, and so on, i made a <a href="http://webchat-1.000webhostapp.com/">PHPChat</a> with a backend based on a PHP Restful-API to manage authentication and messages, coupled with a MariaDB database.
<br><br>
The front-end part, on the other hand, is entirely handled by **JavaScript** with AJAX Requests, and by **Bootstrap + Vanilla CSS** for the CSS part.

As you may noticed here, the validation is dynamic, the user type something, hit the submit button and JavaScript + the PHP API do the rest.

Here, the post message is not dynamic, so we post to the API with the \<form\> directly. However, the update and delete functionnality are dynamic, javascript update/remove the element from the DOM (front-side) and does an AJAX request to the API to update/remove it from the database (backend-side).

The validation of the entered password is also dynamic.
