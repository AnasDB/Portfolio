In order to gain experience with API development and some concepts like interactivity, designing a responsive UI, and so on, i made a PHP chat with a backend based on a PHP API to manage authentication and messages, coupled with a MariaDB database.
<br><br>
On the other hand, the front-end is entirely handled by **JavaScript** with AJAX requests, and by **Bootstrap + Vanilla CSS** for the CSS part.

### üîê Login

</video>

As you may noticed, the validation is done with AJAX, so it's dynamic.

### üí¨ Chat

The \<form\> is directly posted to the API. However, the update and delete fonctionnalities are done in JavaScript with AJAX requests.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Settings page

</video>

The validation of the entered password is also done with AJAX requests.
