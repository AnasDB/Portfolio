As Iâ€™ve mentioned before, Iâ€™m currently pursuing a bachelorâ€™s degree in the field of networks and telecommunications, where Iâ€™m often tasked with configuring IP addresses and machine routes. Therefore, I wanted to automate and simplify this task by developing a small script that facilitates configuration using a TUI (Text User Interface) and short commands. I chose the scripting language I am most comfortable with: Python.
