To gain more experience in object-oriented development in PHP, as well as in API development and in the usage of AJAX requests, I redesigned one of my previous projects :  a **monitoring website** that displays information in real-time.
<br>The `api.php` file serves as a link between HTTP requests and calls to various methods within the <a href="https://github.com/NullBrunk/PHPMonitor/tree/main/App/Class" target="_blank">Classes I have developed</a>.
<br><br>
The front-end part, on the other hand, is entirely handled by **JavaScript** with AJAX requests and ChartJS for the graphs, and by **Tailwind** for the CSS part.
